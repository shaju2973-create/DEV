# Deploy GnKAlgo

You can go live in two stages. Use **developer production (staging)** first. Use **www.gnkalgo.com** only after SMTP, Postgres, HTTPS, and secrets are real.

This cloud agent cannot attach your domain by itself. You need a VPS or a host (Hetzner, AWS Mumbai, DigitalOcean, Render, Railway).

## What is ready now

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| App (auth, dashboard, paper orders, webhooks, AI stub) | Ready for staging |
| Docker production compose | `docker-compose.prod.yml` |
| Live Dhan/Groww orders | Needs broker keys + Dhan static IP |
| Custom domain + TLS | You must point DNS and add HTTPS (Caddy/Nginx/Cloudflare) |

## Option A — Developer production (recommended next)

Use a cheap VPS in India (Mumbai/Bangalore) and a subdomain:

- App: `https://dev.gnkalgo.com`
- API: `https://api-dev.gnkalgo.com`

On the server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:griyaz/GnKAlgo.git
cd GnKAlgo
git checkout main
cp .env.production.example .env
# edit .env: SECRET_KEY, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, SMTP_*, FRONTEND_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Put Cloudflare or Caddy in front for HTTPS. Point DNS A records to the VPS public IP.

**Oracle Cloud Ubuntu 24 + Nginx + Cloudflare (full steps):** see `docs/DEPLOY-ORACLE.md`.

## Option B — Public production (`www.gnkalgo.com`)

Do this after staging works:

1. Postgres (not SQLite)
2. Strong `SECRET_KEY` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
3. Working SMTP (verification mail)
4. HTTPS on `www.gnkalgo.com` and `api.gnkalgo.com`
5. CORS `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` set to those URLs
6. Static egress IP for Dhan order APIs
7. Set `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true` only after the live readiness checklist
8. MFA, active subscription, market hours, kill switch, risk limits, broker
   health, and audit logging are enforced centrally for every live path
9. Backups of Postgres

## Option C — Managed hosts (less server work)

- **Frontend:** Vercel/Netlify, env `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- **Backend + ML + Postgres + Redis:** Render, Railway, or Fly.io in `ap-south-1` if available

## Local vs staging vs live

| | Local | Developer production | Live |
|--|-------|----------------------|------|
| URL | localhost:3000 | dev.gnkalgo.com | www.gnkalgo.com |
| DB | SQLite | Postgres | Postgres |
| Orders | Paper | Paper + test brokers | Live brokers |
| Email | Link on screen until SMTP | Real SMTP | Real SMTP |

## After deploy, smoke test

1. Open the site over HTTPS  
2. Register → email verify → login  
3. Place a **paper** order  
4. Connect Dhan only after static IP is whitelisted  

Do not trade live money until risk checks, MFA, and broker sandbox/test are confirmed.

Run the readiness probe after each deploy:

```bash
curl -fsS https://api.gnkalgo.com/health/ready
```

The API intentionally fails closed when required secrets or provider
configuration is missing.
